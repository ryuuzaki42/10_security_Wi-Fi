Wifite - An automated wireless attack tool

Wifite2 - Rewrite of the popular wireless network auditor, "wifite"

Wifite runs existing wireless-auditing tools for you. Stop memorizing command arguments & switches!

Wifite is designed to use all known methods for retrieving the password of a wireless access point (router). These methods include:

    WPS: The Offline Pixie-Dust attack
    WPS: The Online Brute-Force PIN attack
    WPA: The WPA Handshake Capture + offline crack.
    WPA: The PMKID Hash Capture + offline crack.
    WEP: Various known attacks against WEP, including fragmentation, chop-chop, aireplay, etc.

Run wifite, select your targets, and Wifite will automatically start trying to capture or crack the password.
